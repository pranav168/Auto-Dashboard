## Outlier Removal:
The best way for doing a Multivate Anomaly detection is to use machine Learning algorithm called Isolation Forest, the only drawback in this Model is the determination of Contamination in data should be known before hand, this drawback can be solved by Visualizing data at various contaminations and extract out the best value of contamination without loosing any information from the Data, thus this tool can help reshearchers to get the most optimum amount of contamination in the data, theirby making the process of outlier removal really very easy.
